# go-net

## Introduction
This library contains some basic validation and helpers for handling IP addresses, IP networks, IP ranges (from - to IP adress), domain names, FQDN (fully qualified domain names), and URL. 
All methods that work with IP addresses are IPv4 and IPv6 compliant.

Please see the unit tests (xx_test.go) for examples.
